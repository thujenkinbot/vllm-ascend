"""ZMQ scheduler channels and Passive EngineCore process for vllm-ascend.

This module is the vllm-ascend home of four classes that previously lived in
``vllm/v1/engine/core.py`` of the vllm-pdmix downstream fork:

* :class:`PPSchedulerZmqPublisher` — pp rank0 → pp rank1 SchedulerOutput
  publisher (PUSH socket + background pickling thread).
* :class:`PPSchedulerZmqSubscriber` — pp rank1 receiver counterpart.
* :class:`PPSchedulerZmqChannel` — bidirectional channel that owns one
  publisher + one subscriber for the edge-cloud PD-separation flow.
* :class:`PassiveEngineCoreProc` — non-leader PP rank engine process driver
  that consumes scheduler decisions over ZMQ instead of producing them.

All hooks back into the upstream ``EngineCore`` / ``EngineCoreProc`` lifecycle
are installed by :mod:`vllm_ascend.patch.platform.patch_engine_core` so that
the upstream ``vllm/v1/engine/core.py`` stays untouched.

    A `PPSchedulerZmqChannel` owns one send side (a `PPSchedulerZmqPublisher`)
    and one receive side (a `PPSchedulerZmqSubscriber`), each backed by its
    own dedicated ZMQ PUSH / PULL socket on independent endpoints. It is the
    symmetric primitive needed by the edge-cloud PD-separation flow:

    - Edge constructs one channel with::

          send_endpoint = "tcp://*:<PRE_OUT_PORT>"          # bind, edge → cloud
          recv_endpoint = "tcp://<cloud_addr>:<POST_OUT_PORT>"   # connect

      batches, and ``consume_new_outputs()`` to drain PREFILL_LAST /
      DECODE_LAST batches returned from the cloud.

    - Cloud constructs the mirror channel with::

          send_endpoint = "tcp://*:<POST_OUT_PORT>"          # bind, cloud → edge
          recv_endpoint = "tcp://<master_addr>:<PRE_OUT_PORT>"   # connect

      The same publish/consume API drives the opposite traffic direction.

    Both endpoints use the same PUSH/PULL + background-thread + queue.Queue
    bridge as the legacy unidirectional classes, so no scheduler-thread time
    is spent on pickling or socket I/O.

    Channel naming (``name``) is purely diagnostic; it is included in the
    log lines emitted by the underlying publisher / subscriber so the two
    edge-cloud channels can be told apart in a single combined log.
